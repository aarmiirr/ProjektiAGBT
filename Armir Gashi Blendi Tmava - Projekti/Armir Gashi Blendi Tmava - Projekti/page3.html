										<h2>The
										Gleaners</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gleaners" class="image fit"><img src="images/thegleaners.jpg"></a>
									<p>The Gleaners depicts three peasant women gleaning a field of stray stalks of wheat after the harvest. The painting is famous for featuring in a sympathetic way what were then the lowest ranks of rural society; it was received poorly by the French upper classes.Having recently come out of the French Revolution of 1848, these prosperous classes saw the painting as glorifying the lower-class worker.[1] To them, it was a reminder that French society was built upon the labor of the working masses, and landowners linked this working class with the growing movement of Socialism.[2] The depiction of the working class in The Gleaners made the upper classes feel uneasy about their status. The masses of workers greatly outnumbered the members of the upper class. This disparity in numbers meant that if the lower class were to revolt, the upper class would be overturned. With the French Revolution still fresh in the minds of the upper classes, this painting was not perceived well.</p>

										<h2>The Night
									Watch</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Watch" class="image fit"><img src="images/thenightwatch.jpg"></a>
									<p>The painting is famous for three things: its colossal size (363 cm × 437 cm (11.91 ft × 14.34 ft)), the dramatic use of light and shadow (tenebrism) and the perception of motion in what would have traditionally been a static military group portrait. The painting was completed in 1642, at the peak of the Dutch Golden Age. It depicts the eponymous company moving out, led by Captain Frans Banninck Cocq (dressed in black, with a red sash) and his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburch (dressed in yellow, with a white sash). With effective use of sunlight and shade, Rembrandt leads the eye to the three most important characters among the crowd: the two men in the center (from whom the painting gets its original title), and the woman in the centre-left background carrying a chicken. Behind them, the company's colors are carried by the ensign, Jan Visscher Cornelissen. The figures are almost life-size.</p>

										<h2>Self Portrait Without Beard</h2>

									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-portrait_without_beard" class="image fit"><img src="images/selfportraitwithoutbeard.jpg"></a>
									<p>Self-portrait without beard is an 1889 oil on canvas painting by the post-impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh. The picture, which may have been Van Gogh's last self-portrait, was painted in September that year. 
The self-portrait is one of the most expensive paintings of all time, selling for $71.5 million in 1998 in New York City. At the time, it was the third (or an inflation-adjusted fourth) most expensive painting ever sold.</p>

										<h2>The School<br />

									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens" class="image fit"><img src="images/theschoolofathens.jpg"></a>
									<p>The School of Athens is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael. It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the rooms now known as the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican.The subject of the painting is actually philosophy, or at least ancient Greek philosophy. Indeed, Plato and Aristotle appear to be the central figures in the scene. However, many of the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of first causes. The architecture contains Roman elements, but the general semi-circular setting having Plato and Aristotle at its centre might be alluding to Pythagoras's monad.</p>

										<h2>The Sleeping<br />
										Gypsy</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleeping_Gypsy" class="image fit"><img src="images/thesleepinggypsy.jpg"></a>
									<p>The Sleeping Gypsy (French: La Bohémienne endormie) is an 1897 oil painting by French Naïve artist Henri Rousseau (1844–1910). It is a fantastical depiction of a lion musing over a sleeping woman on a moonlit night.Rousseau first exhibited the painting at the 13th Salon des Indépendants, and tried unsuccessfully to sell it to the mayor of his hometown, Laval. 
<br>
There are several aspects that The Sleeping Gypsy reflects modernism. One of the symbol is the description of the lion. Lion use to impress people as a cruel predator, which represents danger. Whereas in this picture, the lion seems peace and kind.Rousseau described his painting as follows: "A wandering Negress, a mandolin player, lies with her jar beside her (a vase with drinking water), overcome by fatigue in a deep sleep. A lion chances to pass by, picks up her scent yet does not devour her. There is a moonlight effect, very poetic.</p>

										<h2>The Son <br />

									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Son_of_Man" class="image fit"><img src="images/thesonofman.jpg"></a>
									<p>The Son of Man (French: Le fils de l'homme) is a 1964 painting by the Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte. It is perhaps his best-known artwork.

Magritte painted it as a self-portrait.The painting consists of a man in an overcoat and a bowler hat standing in front of a low wall, beyond which are the sea and a cloudy sky. The man's face is largely obscured by a hovering green apple. However, the man's eyes can be seen peeking over the edge of the apple. Another subtle feature is that the man's left arm appears to bend backwards at the elbow.</p>
