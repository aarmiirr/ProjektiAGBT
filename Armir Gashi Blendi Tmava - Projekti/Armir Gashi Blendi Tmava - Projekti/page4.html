										<h2>The
										Swing</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swing_(Fragonard)" class="image fit"><img src="images/theswing.jpg"></a>
									<p>The painting depicts an elegant young woman on a swing. A smiling young man, hiding in the bushes on the left, watches her from a vantage point that allows him to see up into her billowing dress, where his arm is pointed with hat in hand. A smiling older man, who is nearly hidden in the shadows on the right, propels the swing with a pair of ropes. The older man appears to be unaware of the young man. As the young lady swings high, she throws her left leg up, allowing her dainty shoe to fly through the air. The lady is wearing a berg√®re hat (shepherdess hat). Two statues are present, one of a putto, who watches from above the young man on the left with its finger in front of its lips in a sign of silence, the other of pair of putti, who watch from beside the older man, on the right. There is a small dog shown barking in the lower right hand corner, in front of the older man.</p>

										<h2>The

									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog" class="image fit"><img src="images/thewanderer.jpg"></a>
									<p>In the foreground, a man stands upon a rocky precipice with his back to the viewer. He is wrapped in a dark green overcoat, and grips a walking stick in his right hand.His hair caught in a wind, the wanderer gazes out on a landscape covered in a thick sea of fog. In the middle ground, several other ridges, perhaps not unlike the ones the wanderer himself stands upon, jut out from the mass.Through the wreaths of fog, forests of trees can be perceived atop these escarpments. In the far distance, faded mountains rise in the left, gently leveling off into lowland plains in the right. Beyond here, the pervading fog stretches out indefinitely, eventually commingling with the horizon and becoming indistinguishable from the cloud-filled sky.</p>

										<h2>Alexander The Great
									  In His Deathbed</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="http://hassansneaks.blogspot.com/2010/05/alexander-great-in-his-death-bed.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/alexanderdeath.jpg"></a>
									<p>The Great Greek King, Alexander the Great, after conquering many kingdoms, was returning home. On the way, he fell ill and he was bed ridden for months.
<br>
With death drawing close, Alexander realized how his conquests, his army, his sharp sword and all his wealth were of no use in front of death."Bury my body, do not build any monument, keep my hands outside so that the world knows the person who won the world had nothing in his hand when dying."

									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_the_Horatii" class="image fit"><img src="images/oathofthehorati.jpg"></a>
									<p>A depiction of a scene from a Roman legend about a seventh-century BC dispute between two warring cities, Rome and Alba Longa, and stresses the importance of patriotism and masculine self-sacrifice for one's country. Instead of the two cities sending their armies to war, they agree to choose three men from each city; the victor in that fight will be the victorious city.</p>

										<h2>Tartini's Devil
										 Trill Sonata Dream</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_Sonata_in_G_minor_(Tartini)" class="image fit"><img src="images/tartinisdeviltrill.jpg"></a>
									<p>One night, in the year 1713 I dreamed I had made a pact with the devil for my soul. Everything went as I wished: my new servant anticipated my every desire. Among other things, I gave him my violin to see if he could play. How great was my astonishment on hearing a sonata so wonderful and so beautiful, played with such great art and intelligence, as I had never even conceived in my boldest flights of fantasy. I felt enraptured, transported, enchanted: my breath failed me, and I awoke. I immediately grasped my violin in order to retain, in part at least, the impression of my dream. In vain! The music which I at this time composed is indeed the best that I ever wrote, and I still call it the "Devil's Trill", but the difference between it and that which so moved me is so great that I would have destroyed my instrument and have said farewell to music forever if it had been possible for me to live without the enjoyment it affords me.</p>

										<h2>The Pale
										Blue Dot</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot" class="image fit"><img src="images/palebluedot.jpg"></a>
									<p>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.</p>
