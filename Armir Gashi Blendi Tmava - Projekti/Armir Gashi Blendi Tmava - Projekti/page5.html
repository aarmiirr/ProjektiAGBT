										<h2>The Garden
										Of Earthly Delights</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Earthly_Delights" class="image fit"><img src="images/thegardenofearthlydelights.jpg"></a>
									<p>As little is known of Bosch's life or intentions, interpretations of his intent range from an admonition of worldly fleshy indulgence, to a dire warning on the perils of life's temptations, to an evocation of ultimate sexual joy. The intricacy of its symbolism, particularly that of the central panel, has led to a wide range of scholarly interpretations over the centuries.
<br>
Twentieth-century art historians are divided as to whether the triptych's central panel is a moral warning or a panorama of paradise lost.Bosch painted three large triptychs (the others are The Last Judgment of c. 1482 and The Haywain Triptych of c. 1516) that can be read from left to right and in which each panel was essential to the meaning of the whole.</p>

										<h2>Impression,Sunrise
			</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression,_Sunrise" class="image fit"><img src="images/impressionsunrise.jpg"></a>
									<p>Impression, Sunrise depicts the port of Le Havre at sunrise, the two small rowboats in the foreground and the red Sun being the focal elements. In the middle ground, more fishing boats are included, while in the background on the left side of the painting are clipper ships with tall masts. Behind them are other misty shapes that "are not trees but smokestacks of pack boats and steamships, while on the right in the distance are other masts and chimneys silhouetted against the sky.In order to show these features of industry, Monet eliminated existing houses on the left side of the jetty, leaving the background unobscured.</p>

										<h2>Liberty Leading The People
										</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Leading_the_People" class="image fit"><img src="images/libertyleadingthepeople.jpg"></a>
									<p>Delacroix depicted Liberty as both an allegorical goddess-figure and a robust woman of the people. The mound of corpses and wreckage acts as a kind of pedestal from which Liberty strides, barefoot and bare-breasted, out of the canvas and into the space of the viewer. According to Marcus Rediker,she might have been inspired by a Dutch portrait of a fighting Anne Bonny. The Phrygian cap she wears had come to symbolize liberty during the first French Revolution, of 1789. The painting has been seen as a marker to the end of the Age of Enlightenment, as many scholars see the end of the French Revolution as the start of the Romantic era.

The fighters are from a mixture of social classes, ranging from the bourgeoisie represented by the young man in a top hat, a student from the prestigious Ã‰cole Polytechnique wearing the traditional bicorne, to the revolutionary urban worker, as exemplified by the boy holding pistols. What they have in common is the fierceness and determination in their eyes. Aside from the flag held by Liberty, a second, minute tricolore can be discerned in the distance flying from the towers of Notre-Dame.</p>

										<h2>The Third Of May 1808
										</h2>

									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_of_May_1808" class="image fit"><img src="images/thethirdofmay.jpg"></a>
									<p>The Third of May 1808 is set in the early hours of the morning following the uprisingand centers on two masses of men: one a rigidly poised firing squad, the other a disorganized group of captives held at gunpoint. Executioners and victims face each other abruptly across a narrow space; according to Kenneth Clark, "by a stroke of genius [Goya] has contrasted the fierce repetition of the soldiers' attitudes and the steely line of their rifles, with the crumbling irregularity of their target.A square lantern situated on the ground between the two groups throws a dramatic light on the scene. The brightest illumination falls on the huddled victims to the left, whose numbers include a monk or friar in prayer. To the immediate right and at the center of the canvas, other condemned figures stand next in line to be shot.The central figure is the brilliantly lit man kneeling amid the bloodied corpses of those already executed, his arms flung wide in either appeal or defiance. His yellow and white clothing repeats the colors of the lantern. His plain white shirt and sun-burnt face show he is a simple laborer.</p>

									<p>The image depicts an enormous wave threatening three boats off the coast in the Sagami Bay (Kanagawa Prefecture) while Mount Fuji rises in the background. Sometimes assumed to be a tsunami, the wave is more likely to be a large rogue wave.
