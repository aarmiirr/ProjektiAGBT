										<h2>Mona
										Lisa</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa" class="image fit"><img src="images/Monalisa.jpg"></a>
									<p>It is no surprise to see the Mona Lisa at the top of this list. Da Vinci’s masterpiece is probably the most recognized artwork in the world today, and the most visited. Also known as La Giaconda, the painting is believed to illustrate the wife of wealthy Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo. Alternative suggestions include Leonardo’s mother and a self-portrait of the artist. Why is this work so revered? It is a combination of the Mona Lisa and the distant backdrop that frames her, and the harmony that exists in the perspectival representation Da Vinci rendered so well. The Mona Lisa revolutionized portrait painting for future artists. His choice of clothing is not fashionable but rather timeless. This mysterious woman has subsequently become the subject of song and film titles and the works of other renowned artists.

										<h2>The
										Kiss</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_(Klimt)" class="image fit"><img src="images/thekiss.jpg"></a>
									<p>The Kiss is an exotic and opulent-looking work with rich oils and layers of applied gold leaf. The Kiss is an instantly recognizable work with countless reproductions on posters, bags, ceramics, and vases that have been produced around the world. Strikingly modern, influenced by the curvy sinuous lines of Art Nouveau, the work has a strong organic feel to it. Painted in an almost perfect square, Klimt’s masterpiece differs from the more common rectangular surface. The Kiss captures the light through its overarching golden hue, giving the painting its luminous quality. Klimt’s use of gold was no doubt inspired by his trip to Italy, and the stunning Byzantinian mosaics found in Ravenna’s basilica. Central to the work is a woman intimately embraced by her male companion. Their elaborate robes are delineated with the female’s curvilinear and circular forms, and the rectangular decorative elements of the male’s cloak. The couple, lost in the intensity of the moment, kneel on a patch of flowers. The woman wears a tight-fitting dress that highlights the curves of her body, while he envelops her with his arms and his gown.</p>

										<h2>The Persistence
										Of Memory</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Memory" class="image fit"><img src="images/thepersistenceofmemory.jpg"></a>
									<p>Looking for a world-famous, tiny painting that packs a huge punch? Enter the self-proclaimed genius Salvador Dalí and his famous droopy clocks in crazy dreamlike landscapes. Of all his work, The Persistence of Memory is arguably his most famous, executed with Dalí’s usual detailed precision. The initial reaction is often, “What am I looking at?” The painting immediately turns our sense of normality on its head with its malleable clocks and the strange arrangement of objects within this dreamy landscape. The Persistence of Memory challenges many viewers on first glance, and yet its sense of fun draws you in a seductive attack on what is real. An autobiographical aspect, the sea and hills are reminiscent of the artist’s Catalonian home landscape. At the center is the deformed character, with its large nose and its eye with its equally large eyelash that extends to the contours of the nose. Dalí’s famous clocks were supposedly born out of the artist’s response to looking at melted cheese. And then, of course, there are those links to Freud, the unconscious and the dreamscape, where irrational thoughts in our minds play out.</p>

										<h2>American
										Gothic</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gothic" class="image fit"><img src="images/americangothic.jpg"></a>
									<p>Named from the style of the building in the background of this painting, American Gothic has long been a cultural icon of a nation. Painted in 1930s America, Wood’s painting represents America, Middle America, and small-town America all at the same time. Along with Thomas Hart Benton and some other artists, Wood’s style was linked to the Regionalist painting genre. Pictured here are a farmer and his daughter (although the actual models were Wood’s dentist and his daughter). Part of the fascination people have for the work is the contradictory readings people attribute to it. Either way, the work suggests hardworking individuals who toil the land, a conservative America that contrasted with the growing industrial culture of the time, and a symbol of the American heartland.</p>

										<h2>Dance At Le Moulin
										De La Galette</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_du_moulin_de_la_Galette" class="image fit"><img src="images/danceatlemoulindelagalette.jpg"></a>
									<p>This painting is arguably Renoir’s most famous work, depicting a lively and energetic atmosphere in a Parisian dance garden, the Moulin de la Galette. As an Impressionist, Renoir sets about capturing the moment through his brush strokes and use of color. His palate is vivid with a mix of blues, oranges, pinks and reds, helping to create the sense of movement the viewer experiences in the painting. Dapples of light are cast through the leaves upon those visiting the garden, further enhancing this sense of movement. Central to the painting is the subject of fun and pleasure experienced on the outskirts of Paris. Through loose, almost sketch-like brushwork, Renoir added a feeling of movement. There is also a sense that everyone knows each other, for example, the familiarity of the two central women, one flirting with the man before her while the other leans in over her shoulder.Like other works of Renoir's early maturity, Bal du moulin de la Galette is a typically Impressionist snapshot of real life. It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering, sun-dappled light.</p>

										<h2>Girl With A
										Pearl Earring</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring" class="image fit"><img src="images/girlwithapearlearring.jpg"></a>
									<p>Girl with a Pearl Earring, or the “Mona Lisa of the North,” is painted by the 17th-century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. A deceptively simple portrait, Girl with a Pearl Earring is enigmatic. No name is given and all the audience sees is a girl who has a pearl earring and is staring back. Speculation around the girl’s identity ranges from being Vermeer’s mistress to being one of his 15 children. The girl’s hair is tied back in a blue band contrasting with the gold of her dress and is offset by the dark background, giving the painting its luminosity. Her mouth is open as though she is about to ask a question, but what is she thinking? The painting is a tronie rather than a portrait, depicting the subject’s head dressed in its Eastern turban. This headdress, together with the exceptionally large pearl, conjures up the exotic.
